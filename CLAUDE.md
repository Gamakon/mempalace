## The Mission

Memory is identity. When an AI forgets everything between conversations, it cannot build real understanding — of you, your work, your people, your life.

MemPalace exists to solve this. It is a memory system — not a search engine, not a RAG pipeline, not a vector database wrapper. It treats every word you have shared as sacred, stores it verbatim, and makes it instantly available. Your data never leaves your machine. We never summarize. We never paraphrase. We return your exact words.

100% recall is the design requirement — the target every search path is measured against. Anything less means forgetting, and forgetting means starting over.

The name comes from the ancient "method of loci" — the memory palace technique used for thousands of years to organize and recall vast amounts of information by placing it in imagined rooms of an imagined building. We were also inspired by the Zettelkasten method (created by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann) — small cross-referenced index cards that point to each other. We apply both ideas to AI memory:

- **Wings** for broad categories (people, projects, topics)
- **Rooms** for time-based groupings (days, sessions)
- **Drawers** for full verbatim content (your exact words)
- **AAAK compression** for the index layer — a compact symbolic format (via `dialect.py`) that lets an LLM scan thousands of entries instantly and know exactly which drawer to open

## Design Principles

These are non-negotiable. Every PR, every feature, every refactor must honor them.

- **Verbatim always** — Never summarize, paraphrase, or lossy-compress user data. The system searches the index and returns the original words. If a user said it, we store exactly what they said. This is the foundational promise.
- **Incremental only** — Append-only ingest after initial build. Never destroy existing data to rebuild. A crash mid-operation must leave the existing palace untouched.
- **Entity-first** — Everything is keyed by real names with disambiguation by DOB, ID, or context. People matter more than topics.
- **Local-first, zero API** — All extraction, chunking, and embedding happens on the user's machine. No cloud dependency for memory operations. No API keys required.
- **Performance budgets** — Hooks under 500ms. Startup injection under 100ms. Memory should feel instant.
- **Privacy by architecture** — The system physically cannot send your data because it never leaves your machine. No telemetry, no phone-home, no external service dependencies for core operations.
- **Background everything** — Filing, indexing, timestamps, and pipeline work happen via hooks in the background. Nothing interrupts the user's conversation. Zero tokens spent on bookkeeping in the chat window.

## Contributing

We welcome bug fixes, performance improvements, new language support, better entity disambiguation, documentation, and test coverage.

We do not accept summarization of user content, cloud storage/sync features, telemetry or analytics, features requiring API keys for core memory, or shortcuts that bypass verbatim storage.

# Migrate an existing Chroma palace to Surreal (drawers + KG)
mempalace migrate-to-surreal --include-kg
mempalace migrate-to-surreal --sqlite-direct   # for palaces with corrupt/huge HNSW
mempalace migrate-kg-to-surreal                # KG only

## Conventions

- **Python style**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Linter**: ruff with E/F/W rules
- **Formatter**: ruff format, double quotes
- **Commits**: conventional commits (`fix:`, `feat:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `ci:`)
- **Tests**: `tests/test_*.py`, fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`
- **Coverage**: 85% threshold (80% on Windows due to ChromaDB file lock cleanup)

## Architecture

```
User → CLI / MCP Server → Storage Backend (Chroma default; Surreal for concurrent writes)
                        → Knowledge graph (SQLite on Chroma; SurrealDB on Surreal)

Palace structure:
  WING (person/project)
    └── ROOM (day/topic)
          └── DRAWER (verbatim text chunk)

Index layer (AAAK):
  Compressed pointers → DRAWER locations
  Scanned by LLM to find relevant drawers without reading all content

Knowledge Graph:
  ENTITY → PREDICATE → ENTITY (with valid_from / valid_to dates)
```

## Key Files for Common Tasks

- **Adding an MCP tool**: `mempalace/mcp_server.py` — add handler function + TOOLS dict entry
- **Changing search**: `mempalace/searcher.py`
- **Modifying mining**: `mempalace/miner.py` (project files) or `mempalace/convo_miner.py` (transcripts)
- **Adding a storage backend**: subclass `mempalace/backends/base.py`, register in `backends/__init__.py`
- **Input validation**: `mempalace/config.py` — `sanitize_name()` / `sanitize_content()`
- **Tests**: mirror source structure in `tests/test_<module>.py`

## Backends

MemPalace has a pluggable backend layer. Two backends ship in-tree:

- **Chroma** (default) — ChromaDB + SQLite KG. Simplest install, single-writer. Fine for one MCP/CLI process at a time.
- **Surreal** — SurrealDB (local, embedded `surrealkv`) for drawers and KG. Supports **multi-process concurrent writes**, which Chroma's SQLite lock does not. Recommended when multiple Claude Code sessions, agents, or hooks may write simultaneously.

Select a backend (resolution order: env var -> config file -> default):

```bash
export MEMPALACE_BACKEND=surreal     # or: chroma
# or set "backend": "surreal" in ~/.mempalace/config.json
```

Local Surreal server setup: see [`docs/surrealdb-local.md`](docs/surrealdb-local.md). Migration from an existing Chroma palace uses `mempalace migrate-to-surreal --include-kg` (see Commands).

Test parity: full suite passes against both backends (`MEMPALACE_BACKEND=surreal` to force Surreal).
